# TARDIS-Blue

A Tumblr userstyle to make your dashboard — well — TARDIS Blue.

## Installation:

* You'll need to install the Stylish extension for either [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/?src=external-userstyleshome)
* Go to [this theme's userstyles.org page](http://userstyles.org/styles/70732/tardis-blue-tumblr-dashboard-theme) and install it
* Head on back to your Tumblr dashboard and weep with **JOY**.

## Notes

* This is a bit of fun, and isn't intended to change the world.
* All images are base64 encoded and included in the CSS that way - I added them here in case you need to make any adjustments, but don't forget to run them through an image-to-base64-string encoder
* I don't claim any copyright to the term TARDIS, or this particular shade of blue, in case that's trademarked as well. I'm not making any money from it, and I'm hoping this is considered fair-use.
